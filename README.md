# Heart-Disease-Prediction-Model
Cardiovascular diseases are one of the leading causes of death worldwide. The ability to predict heart disease from clinical and personal data can assist in early diagnosis, saving lives. In this project, we utilize the **Heart Disease UCI** dataset to predict whether a person has heart disease or not, using a logistic regression model.
